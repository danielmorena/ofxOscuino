# ofxOscuino
=====================================

Introduction
------------

This is a quick and dirty library for using the [Oscuino](http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/oscuino) library for OSC on Arduino.  It works as a bridge between the serial port and the UDP libraries.

Installation
------------
Any steps necessary to install your addon. Optimally, this means just dropping the folder into the `openFrameworks/addons/` folder.

Dependencies
------------

This addon uses the serial library from `ofxNetwork`.
The example also uses `ofxOsc`, obviously, though the library doesn't depend on it.

Compatibility
------------
This has been tested with Open Frameworks 8.4 on OSX.

Known issues
------------
Any specific (and long-living) issues/limitations you want to mention? For bugs, etc. you should use the issue tracker of your addon's repository

Version history
------------
It make sense to include a version history here (newest releases first), describing new features and changes to the addon. Use [git tags](http://learn.github.com/p/tagging.html) to mark release points in your repo, too!

### Version 0.1 (April 20, 2015):
